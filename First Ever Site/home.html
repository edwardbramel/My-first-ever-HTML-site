        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p class="p1">Hello and welcome to Weigh Protein offical website. The people here at Weigh Protein provide the
            finest of the fine
            protein powder known to man. <i>Whey</i> is a form of protein collected from the milking process of the cow.
            The
            chunky stuff from milk is often collected and disposed until some random dude found out you can get mad
            <strong>GAINZ</strong> by collecting this stuff. But the dude who found this out also decided to do some
            sciene
            and figured out that "milk is made of two proteins, caseins and whey. Whey can be separated from the
            casein"(<a class="source" title="how whey protein is made"
                href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/263371#:~:text=Milk%20is%20made%20of%20two,is%20low%20in%20lactose%20content.">according
                to this source</a>). Often this occurs in the process
            when making cheese. The digusting chunky stuff that looks like spolid milk is very dense in protein and is
            also very lean.

            The protein by itself is very usfull and can be added to many food items that are factory made. Whey might
            be the biggest technology advancments in human health history becuase of its ability to top things off. When
            your done with your meal have a protein drink, when you need a snack have a protein bar or drink. Whey
            allows you to add in roughly 25grams of proteins into any meal. Body builders and fitness gurus love this
            because it helps them hit there daily <a title="what is MACRO's?"

            nutrients. The ratio of protein to fat/carbs is something many people struggle with in the American life
            style. As Americans we have fast food and abudance or calories sitting in front of us everyday with out much
            energy output. This collecton of carbs leads to fat and an unhealthy maintance level of calories that
            majority of people do not need. Our life style has changed and if we are gonna eat, make every meal count.
            Don't eat chips have some sort of protein.

        <p class="p3">Here you see what weigh can really do for you if you maximize it right. Just a disclaimer that you
            need to
            workout if you wanna get these results. Hreck was just an average man working his 9-5 and eating unhealhty
            all day. He decied the swamp life wasn't for him. he took a lot of foods out of his daily deit and found
            himself hungry. At first he gave up, but then he knew Eddie Murphy was gonna make fun of him so he started
            trying harder. Then Hreck found Weigh Protein in the store one day and ate it after every meal to fill him
            up. Now that same man is the worlds strongest man beating Hafthor Bjornsson in worlds strongest man.</p>
