        <h2>More About Weigh Protein</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            Weigh Protein was founded in 1993 by Bradley Martin. Bradley was tired of chuging down horribllly tasting
            protein shakes that he drank with his nasty cup that was washed in his dish washer but kept forgeting to dry
            it off before he used it so he got the soapy taste in his mouth. So one day he thought he would just make
            his own horrible flavor. First Bradley started brainstorming flavors, he thought of chocolate, venilla, and
            all the other basic flavors. But it wasn't enough to stand out from the crowd.
            He accidentally split his derritos into his protein shake and realized that would be a great flavor. So the
            first two flavors where derritos and soap water.

            Starting the business was hard work. Bradley didn't entend to make a business out of his flavors he just did
            it for himself. But then his fellow gym bros started bring up how much they hated his flavors, so he decided
            to start selling some of his flavors to people. then next thing you know he met a guy who knew a guy, who
            was realted to a guy who knew a guy who makes whey protein. so they then networked and connected to now
            bradley is operating a full on business. So far bradley is 400,000 dollars in debt and can't seem to pay of
            his investors. so please buy the products to help support bradly.
